# FreeformDeformation

This project uses OpenGL and C++ to enable freeform deformaiton on a rigid object. Please edit line 63 in readShape.cpp to an appropriate path to knight-copy.d. 

Users can manipulate the control points using the mouse, rotate axis by clicking X, Y, or Z on the keyboard, and deform the object by clicking the SPACEBAR.
